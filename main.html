	<h1>Why i want to become a developer ?</h1>
<p>For better or worst, programming involves endless learning. Everyday i can get to work with a new framework, see some new code, learn a new API, etc. This process of self-improvement is very gratifying. Everyday i can be a bit smarter than the day before.</p>
